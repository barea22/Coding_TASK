# Coding_TASK
Google Street View House Numbers Image Processing

Description

This coding task involves processing images of house numbers taken from Google Street View using the Stanford University House Numbers dataset. The dataset contains images cropped to 32Ã—32 pixels, focused on just the number. The primary goal is to learn and apply image processing techniques to recognize and analyze these house numbers. This aspect of coding is crucial for developing skills in computer vision and machine learning, which are widely used in various applications such as autonomous driving, optical character recognition, and smart city infrastructure.
